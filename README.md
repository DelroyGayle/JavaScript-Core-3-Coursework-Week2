## Dog photo gallery

Let's make a randomized dog photo gallery!

Write a function that makes an API call to `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`. It should trigger after clicking a button in your webpage. Every time the button is clicked it should append a new dog image to the DOM.

- Create an `index.html` file that will display your random image
- Add 2 `<button>` and 1 `<ul>` element, either in the HTML or through JavaScript
- When the button is clicked it should make an API call to `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`
- After receiving the data, append to the `<ul>` a `<li>` that contains an `<img>` element with the dog image
- Incorporate error handling

## Programmer humor

Who knew programmers could be funny?

Write an function that makes an API call to `https://xkcd.now.sh/?comic=latest`

1. Create a `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` file to write your code in

- Inside the same file write a program that gets the `json` using Fetch.
- A function should make an API call to the given endpoint: `https://xkcd.now.sh/?comic=latest`
- Log the received data to the console
- Render the `img` property into an `<img>` tag in the DOM
- Incorporate error handling
